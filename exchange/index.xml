By default this artifact will search for linux path glob: /var/logs/**
For Windows hosts please change the target path. Some examples of path glob may include:
Specific binary: /var/logs/log.gz Wildcards: /var/log/*.gz More wildcards: /var/www/**/*.log Multiple extentions: /var/log/**/*\.{log,gz} Windows: C:/Logs/**/*.{gz,log} or **/*.{gz,log} NOTE: this artifact runs the glob plugin with the nosymlink switch turned on.

The artifact:
firstly searches for jar, war and ear files then recursively checks content by name then hash for vulnerable versions. reports hit details. The artifact is optimised to recursively search through embedded jar,war and ear files by extracting any discovered jar containers to a tempfile on disk. Select UploadHits to upload Discovered file for further analysis. It is recommended to increase default artifact timeout for large servers or target glob.</description></item><item><title>Generic.Detection.LunasecLog4shell</title><link>https://docs.velociraptor.app/exchange/artifacts/pages/generic.detection.lunaseclog4shell/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.velociraptor.app/exchange/artifacts/pages/generic.detection.lunaseclog4shell/</guid><description>Uses the Log4Shell scanner of Lunasec to scan the file systems of all drives of the host for any sign of vulnerabilities related to Log4shell
